# Deep Neural Network Architecture

The deep neural network that was used consisted of 3 fully connected layers. This was implemented in PyTorch. ReLU units were used as activation units.

# Algorithm

The algorithm that was used to implement this is the Deep Q Learning algorithm. The full algorithm is outlined in the [Deep Q Network](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/dqn/DQNNaturePaper.pdf) paper
